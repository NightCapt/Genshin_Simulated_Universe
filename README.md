# Genshin_Simulated_Universe
 A program designed to simulate the roguelike mode of honkai star rail in Genshin impact with user's characters/weapons/artifacts
 
 This was zajef77's idea, check out his twitch here: https://www.twitch.tv/zajef77
 
 # How to play
 This is a self imposed Genshin Impact challenge to clear spiral abyss floors 1-12 by starting with traveler, dull blade, no artifacts, and gradually getting characters/artifacts/weapons after clearing every floor. What this program does is take your genshin data for your artifacts, weapons and characters, and offer you choices for all of them after every floor, as well as some currency to reroll your choices and buy artifacts at some points in the run.
 
 Do note that this project is still work in progress, and I am planning to add events/relics/optional challenges for more blessings, as well as visual updates. However, it is playable as is, and hopefully fun.
 
 # Setting up and getting Character data

The Genshin data file is using NightCapt's genshin impact data, make sure to replace it with your own character by "Load Genshin data" data button before playing.

Download inventory camera here:https://github.com/Andrewthe13th/Inventory_Kamera

Make sure to tick both artifacts/characters/weapons in inventory kamera before getting data, otherwise the uploaded data won't work.

You will get a json file which can be imported into the program.
