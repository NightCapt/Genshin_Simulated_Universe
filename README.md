# Genshin_Simulated_Universe
 A program designed to simulate the roguelike mode of honkai star rail in Genshin impact with user's characters/weapons/artifacts
 
 This was zajef77's idea, check out his twitch here: https://www.twitch.tv/zajef77

The data.json file is using NightCapt's genshin impact data, make sure to replace it with your own character data before use.

Make sure to get both artifacts/characters/weapons in your file while scanning and renaming the output file as data.json before replacing the file. I'll add the feature to change the data file in the GUI soon.
